Google has everything for developers, however, it needs developers to configure and select suitable tools. Moreover, non-IT professionals are unable to use google service. If we lower the bar, so the non-IT companies and professionals, even SWEs use Google as a simple toy, that'll be great. 

Agentic workflow for all companies: 
AI will participate in every step:

Google Drive  -> Design doc -> commit in GoogleHub -> implementation -> GoogleHub -> Deploy on GCP -> CI/CD -> SRE -> Customer feedback -> next version 

Clients only need to talk to Gemini, approve each step, iterate their products

Google will focus on Gemini and Infrastructure.
